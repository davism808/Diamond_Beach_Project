# Diamond_Beach_Project
 OCN 682 final project and data set

## OPEN FINAL PROJECT AND DATA SET IN DIAMOND BEACH PROJECT --> DIAMOND BEACH JUPYTER --> FINAL.PROJECT.Diamond.Beach
This project contains the cleaning and tidying process of our final project.

This data set contains values of concentrations of UVF values (BP3 and OC). These concentrations were measured while the metadata contained is related to amount of people, tide information, and time of day.

The goal of this final project is to:
    - Use a mixed model approach 
    - Understand the fluctuations of these UVFs
    
Data wrangling was produced by: Honour Booth.

Exploratory data analysis was done by: Christy Chock.

Analysis and modeling was done by: Madeline Davis.

Final visualization was done by: Honour Booth.

This data set was replicated off of a real data set (not available before publication) to represent a beach on the south shore of Oahu, in the Diamond head area.
